Write the playing XI for both the teams and the computer will play a T20 game.
To specify the name of a fast bowling option, write "(fb)" AFTER their name.
To specify the name of a slow/spin bowling option, write "(sb)" AFTER their name.
To specify the name of a medium pace bowling option, write "(mb)" AFTER their name.
To specify the name of the captain, write "(c)" AFTER their name.
To specify the name of the wicketkeeper, write "(wk)" AFTER their name.
The 3 specifications can be written in any order.

You may add batting and bowling attribute numbers to a player.
In case you are simulating the game with attributes, add the attributes after the name
in square brackets.
Syntax: <player_name>[<bat_attribute>, <bowl_attribute>]

Examples:
Virat Kohli[95, 40] -> A batsman
Rohit Sharma[93, 45](c) -> Captain and batsman
Rishabh Pant[91, 5](wk) -> Wicketkeeper
Jasprit Bumrah[45, 95](fb) -> A fast bowler
Ravindra Jadeja[88, 91](sb) -> A spinner
Shivam Dube[87, 75](mb) -> A medium pace bowler (allowed to bowl)
Hardik Pandya[90, 84](fb) -> A fast bowling all-rounder (allowed to bowl)
